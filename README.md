###Reddit-Twitter bot
This bot copies posts along with their links from /r/Python from Reddit and posts them to twitter. This bot keeps the 140 character length in check and also prevents duplicate posts. So what do you need to get started. 

###Required libraries
- PRAW ```pip install praw```
- Tweepy ```pip install tweepy```

###Access Token
You need to get access token from twitter first. You can easily get them by going to dev.twitter.com/apps and registering an app. After registering you will have to change the access premissions of your app under the settings tab. After you get your access tokens and everything else just paste them in the beginning of the script where I have mentioned in the script.
